For the full constituent, its meaning should also be a property, namely the conjunction of the NP- and PP-provided properties (\"being a flight and originating in New York\" (`lambda x: x in Flight and (x, NewYork) in Origin`)).

If you took this approach, providing a composition function for the rule of the form `lambda PP_PLACE: lambda x: PP_PLACE(x)`, know that these two `PP` meaning options – `PP_PLACE` and `lambda x: PP_PLACE(x)` – are, in an appropriate sense, equivalent.

So far, we've seen how to use the syntactic parse tree to guide the composition of semantic representations. In project segment 4, you will automate this process by implementing such a generic semantic parser, which takes any tree with associated semantic rules, and constructs the meaning representation, doing just the work you've been doing by hand here."
